  conversationEndOptionsPos:
  - "There\u2019s a certain calm that comes with solitude, but it really depends.
    Sometimes strong connection is just as grounding as quiet."
  - I like places where I can relax and find some peace and quiet. Not the biggest
    fan of all those crowded places with tons of people.
  - "It\u2019s often the small, spontaneous things- moments that feel real, shared
    laughter, or when something unexpectedly brightens the day."
  - There are definitely interests that have stayed with me over the years but it's
    a topic for a different conversation
  conversationEndOptionsNeutral:
  - I'm not really into that.
  - That's a difficult question...
  - I don't know.
  - This is... complicated.
  - I've never thought about that to be honest.
  conversationEndOptionsNegative:
  - What kind of question is that?!
  - Let's talk about something else, shall we?
  - How am I spoused to know?!
  - This conversation is getting boring...
  - ...are you a weirdo?
