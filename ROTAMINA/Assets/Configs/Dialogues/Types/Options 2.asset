  - I appreciate activities that give me space to focus quietly and be present. Things
    like that can be really grounding when the pace of life picks up.
  - I usually try to read the room and go with the flow. Sometimes a quick joke or
    just giving someone genuine attention can make a big difference.
  - Mostly those that require a mix of strategy, focus, and personal growth - ones
    that feel meaningful beyond just checking a box.
  - "There are a few spots that seem to bring a sense of quiet, whether it\u2019s
    somewhere in nature or just a familiar, peaceful corner."
