  - I've binge-watched this series last night. Have you watched anything interesting
    lately?
  choicesTXT:
  - I actually watched The Crawling Barely Alive. Kinda fun. I love how Benadryl
    Cumbrel acted there
  - I watch shows as much as my time allows. Sadly not that much anymore
  - I rarely watch shows, but I'm trying my best to pick them up when I get a recommendation
  - I don't watch series. They are too long and I lose interest
